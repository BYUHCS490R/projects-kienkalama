        <h1>Final Proposal</h1>

    <main>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>The title and topic of your site.</li>
            <p>The Title I have choosen is "Finding Balance" and the topic is about the 4 pillars of  health.</p>
            <li>A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</li>
            <p>I chose this topic because I want to study and understand this topic more. I think through studying the 4 pillars of Health will help me to grow Physically, Intelectually, Emotionally and Spiritually. I thin that it will be of most use for me and will help me to develop a growth mindset. I was told about how making small gains in each field can help us to change habits and develop new ones. I also see this project as a way to motivate others.</p>
            <li>List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</li>
            <p>My Home page will be used to talk about a growth mindset and the benefits of having one. I will have a picture and a example of Intlectual, Physical, Emotional and Spiritual in each page. I will use the last page to compile a list of good habits and a summary of want I learned from them. I will make a form for the readers to state different goals that they have. </p>
            <li>What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</li>
            <p>I want to collect the types of goals that they have and use that information to figure out what I should add to my site in order to accomadate the goals that they have. The data that I put on my table is the different types of habits or ideas that I think would help the reader. It will also specify if that goal is a "S", "M", "A", "R", "T" goal (Specfic, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely).</p>
            <li>How will you collect information/images/content for your sites? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</li>
            <p>I will use information from an individual that is a good example of the pillar of health that they represent. I will use images from google of things that I think represent each pillar. For intelectual goals I want to use quotes and pictures from Albert Einstein. For Spiritual goals I want to use quotes and information from Russel M. Nelson. 
            </p>
            <li>Include a statement acknowledging that you have read the warnings below.</li>
            <p>I will not try to cheat on the final because it defeats the purpose of trying to learn. I will also use pictures that are from the creative commons usage rights tool on google. The things I'm unsure about if I can copy quotes from individuals and Can I use chatgbt to make javascript corrections? </p>
