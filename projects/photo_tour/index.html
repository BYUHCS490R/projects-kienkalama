        <p>I wanted to make a Tour of all my favorite experiences that I have had after my mission. I had just gotten back from my mission and I was able to go back to Hawaii. I also was able to go and watch the Conference which had been my dream for a very long time. We also went to Disneyland for my Fathers 50th birthday. I also got to see Stan Walker who is one of my favorite singers in Concert. My favorite pass time is baking which I tend to do on the weekends.  </p>
