  <h2>Internet</h2>  
  <p>The internet connects our computers to each other. It uses cables to connect to servers and transmits information through the cables. I thought information was transmitted over long distances through satellites. I learned that it is not transmitted this way and that they are connected through large cables that are dropped to the bottom of the ocean. I thought it was incredible to know that information can travel that fast and that the information from New York can travel here in milliseconds.

  <h2>Web</h2>
  <p>The Web is a way to format the information using the internet. I thought it was interesting that depending on what language we use it affects how the information on the Web is formatted. HTML stands for hyper text markup language and we use HTML to communicate to the web how we want to organize our information. It was interesting to me that HTML started around the 1990s and that now  we use Html 5. It's also interesting that in English it uses fewer characters than it would in Chinese. Knowing this I wonder how much more difficult it is to learn how to code using Chinese characters.</p>
  <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
  <p>Unicode was made to be an agreement between all languages on what code represented what information. It is also used by all languages, not just English. It can represent more characters than ASCII because it uses more bits.</p>
  <h2>What is UTF-8?</h2>
  <p>UTF-8 stands for Unicode Transformation Format- 8 bit. It is kind of like a translator that is able to speak or represent both Unicode and ASCII. It also made it so that ASCII could use more characters and symbols like emojis.</p>
  <h2>What is does URl mean?</h2>
  <p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. The URL is made up of 6 main parts: the Protocol, Domain, Port, Path, Query and Fragment. The computer reads these parts and it instructs it on how to get there. </p>
  <h2>HTTP</h2>
  <p>HTTP stands for Hyper text transfer protocol.</p>
  <h2>HTTPS</h2>
  <p>HTTPS is the same as HTTP but it is secured using a digital certificate (SSL/TLS)</p>
  <h2>IP Address</h2>
  <p>The IP in IP address means Internet protocol address</p>
  <h2>DNS</h2>
  <p>DNS means Domain Name System.</p>
  <h2>W3C recomendations</h2>
  <p>W3C means World Wide Web Consortium. W3C recommendations are the rules and regulations that the World Wide Web Consortium agrees on. </p>
  <h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
  <p>XML was specifically meant for data
XHTML was made to make Webpages more reliable and have syntax that was clearer.  
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It communicates how to structure your information 
HTML-5 makes representing audio visual files more easier. </p>
