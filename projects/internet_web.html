  <h2>Internet</h2>  
  <p>The internet connects our computers to each other. It uses cables to connect to servers and transmits information through the cables. I thought information was transmitted over long distances through satellites. I learned that it is not transmitted this way and that they are connected through large cables that are dropped to the bottom of the ocean. I thought it was incredible to know that information can travel that fast and that the information from New York can travel here in milliseconds.

  <h2>Web</h2>
  <p>The Web is a way to format the information using the internet. I thought it was interesting that depending on what language we use it affects how the information on the Web is formatted. HTML stands for hyper text markup language and we use HTML to communicate to the web how we want to organize our information. It was interesting to me that HTML started around the 1990s and that now  we use Html 5. It's also interesting that in English it uses fewer characters than it would in Chinese. Knowing this I wonder how much more difficult it is to learn how to code using Chinese characters.</p>
