        <p>What is your favorite element in Avatar the last airbender? In Avatar the Last airbender there are 4 main elements and different sub-elements that people can bend. My favorite element in this series that they can bend is fire. My favorite sub element that people can bend is lava.</p>
        <p>Which nation do you think represents you the most? My favorite nation that the avatar visits is the Water tribe that lives in the swamp. I also think that the sand benders in the earth kingdom were interesting. I did not include the Air nation because the main character Aang is the only airbender in the series</p>
