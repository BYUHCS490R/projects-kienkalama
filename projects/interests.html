    <p>I like to meditate for about 13 mins in the morning. Then I go to the gym to workout for about 30 minutes. I try to get 8 hours of sleep every day which can be difficult. I'm trying to focus on eating protein and cutting out rice and starches but it has been very difficult</p>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What color did you choose to emphasize text? (this text should be that color).</li>
            <p class="orange">I used the color orange to emphasize my title and to guide the reader to the next text. I thought that it contrasted with the other colors the most. </p>
            <li>What color did you choose to de-emphasize text? (this text should be that color).</li>
            <p class="tawny">I used the color tawny instead of tan because the color tan was harder to see in contrast to the background.</p>
            <li>How did you choose your colors? Did you use a tool online to help you find colors?</li>
            <p><span style= color:brown>I was thinking of autumn colors and they were on the “coolors.co” palette generator.</span></p>
