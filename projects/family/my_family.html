                <p>My Brother dressed up as Doctor Strange last year. I honestly don't know why he loves Doctor Strange so much but he says in Marvel's "What if" series he was pretty cool. He used a green light to act as the time stone and he practiced his hand motions</p>

                <p>My Mom loves Spiderman because she read the old comics and seeing all the new ones makes it more interesting to her. Its funny because she hates spiders. If she sees one she tells me to release it outside and not to hurt it</p>

                <p>My Dad loves Super man because it was my late Granfathers favorite Super Hero. My Dad also reminds me of Superman because he uses glasses. His favorite ability that Superman has is that he can fly. </p>
