            <h2>What is the root?</h2>
            <p> That is where your website starts. The domain name matches us to the computer then it matche to a folder in the computer and then it matches us to the URL and then it pulls up the file from that folder.
                <h2>What is a default document? </h2>
                <p>Its a file that is named index.html. You can only have 1 default document in a folder. We add a default document to our folder. It usually directs people back to the home page if they are lost. </p>
